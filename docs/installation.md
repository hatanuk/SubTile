# Installation

Copy the minified code from `build.js` and paste it into your Sprig game's JavaScript section. The `build.js` file contains a complete, condensed version of the source code for SubTile that gives you access to all its classes.

Simply:
1. Open the `build.js` file in this repository
2. Copy all the code (starting from the comment and class definitions)
3. Paste it into the first line of your Sprig JS file.

## Dependencies

SubTile Sprig Renderer has no external dependencies and works entirely within Sprig's built-in JavaScript environment.
